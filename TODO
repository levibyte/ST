Optimize rendering code - (somehow implement batching of draw calls with the standard SDL renderer) - not really necessary though


-remove all string comparisons - these will be hashed
-Frame interpolation - I've no idea really
-Decouple subsystems via a unified message bus
-make level creation much easier ( a level editor maybe?)
-do the f**king error checking eh
